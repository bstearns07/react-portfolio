Notes about recent changes
- All project entries in `src/components/Projects.jsx` now use the local image asset `src/assets/projectlogo.png` instead of remote placeholders. This makes the app work offline and avoids external hotlinking.

Troubleshooting
- If you run into missing asset errors, confirm `src/assets/projectlogo.png` exists. If you see build errors related to Node or Vite, make sure Node.js is up-to-date and run `npm install` again.
